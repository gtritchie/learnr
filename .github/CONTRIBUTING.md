# Contributing

We welcome contributions to the **learnr** package!

To submit a contribution:

1. [Fork](https://github.com/rstudio/learnr/fork) the repository and make your changes.

2. Ensure that you have signed the [individual](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/rstudioindividualcontributoragreement.pdf) or [corporate](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/rstudiocorporatecontributoragreement.pdf) contributor agreement as appropriate. You can send the signed copy to contribute@rstudio.com, cc'ing barret@rstudio.com.

3. Submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).

We generally do not merge pull requests that update included web libraries (such as Bootstrap or jQuery) because it is difficult for us to verify that the update is done correctly; we prefer to update these libraries ourselves.
